ΨΦ is a server primarily for scientific discourse in physics, mathematics and space sciences. In this post, we will look at some of its features which help serve its purpose.

Firstly, the server is neatly categorized into different categories, and each category further has channels for specific topics. Most of the discussions proceed in the 'main' category, with channels for physics, mathematics and space.

Since the subjects mentioned connect a vast variety of other subjects, we have another category for topics such as computer science, philosophy, chemistry and so on.

Each of these subject channels has feature-rich bots such as [TeXit](https://top.gg/bot/510789298321096704), which renders beautiful math from [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), [I Run Code](https://top.gg/bot/730885117656039466) which runs codes in 70+ programming languages and [Interstellar](https://top.gg/bot/707726135173054501) which posts NASA's APODs (Astronomy Photo Of the Day), space news and provides a query system for space-related information.

Next in line, we have a QOTD (Question Of The Day) category with fun questions in the main subjects, and a points system. These will encourage you to solve interesting problems! You can also follow these channels on your own servers to be notified of new problems.

We also have a useful logging system for storing interesting messages. You will find lots of informative resources worth hours' of read in these channels!

No Discord server is complete without voice channels. We have different channels for discussions, general conversations and music.

Last but not the least, to make the community's journey more enjoyable, we also have fun channels for off-topic discussions, polls, memes, chain, and such group activities.

All in all, the server is a lot of fun both in terms of the learning experience and amusements. We look forward to having you among us!
