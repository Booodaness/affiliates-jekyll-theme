Have you ever wondered why the universe works the way it does? Or how mathematics is constructed from first principles? Or what the future of mankind is in outer space? If you have found yourself pondering on such things, you are not alone.

Curiosity is food for the human mind. As the famous theoretical physicist Richard Feynamn remarked,

> I would rather have questions that can't be answered than answers that can't be questioned.

The purpose of ΨΦ is to celebrate the curiosity ingrained in us, which culminated into this age of scientific exploration. Science, rather than being a mere body of knowledge, is a vast arena, with a set of guiding principles to paint a portrait of objective reality. This picture of Nature is dynamic — it constantly evolves, and requires discourse to do so.

We hope that through the scientific discussions in physics, mathematics, space and other topics on our server, we will encourage scientific thinking induced by questioning, finding answers and trying to make sense of what we know. To cover a large target audience and yet, explore the depth of these complex subjects, our discussions are varied from layman to highly technical ones. This means you'll be able to find your own place in the discussions when you join us!

To facilitate smooth scientific discourse, our server has a number of features which are described in [this post]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/tour/).

[Join us today](https://discord.gg/JJDMqH5) to learn physics, mathematics and space sciences in a fun manner.

Cheers!

The ΨΦ team
